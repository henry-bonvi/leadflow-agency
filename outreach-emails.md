# LeadFlow Cold Outreach Emails

## Target: Marketing Agencies

### Email 1: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Quick question about your trade clients

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Saw {{company}} does marketing for home service businesses.

Quick question: are your clients always asking for more leads?

We specialize in generating verified trade business leads (lawn care, plumbing, HVAC, etc.) - emails, phones, websites, all validated.

500 leads, 48hr delivery, $997.

Could be a nice add-on service for your agency, or just fuel for your clients' pipelines.

Worth a quick chat?

Cheers,
Tom

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your trade clients

Hey {{first_name}},

Following up on my note about trade leads.

Just delivered 1,000 verified lawn care leads to a marketing agency last week - they're using them for a cold email campaign for their client.

If lead gen for home service businesses is something you'd use, happy to do a small test batch so you can see the quality.

Cheers,
Tom

### Email 3: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If you ever need verified leads for trade businesses (plumbing, HVAC, lawn care, etc.), we're here.

Closing your file for now - no more emails from me.

Cheers,
Tom
