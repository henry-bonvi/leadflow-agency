# LeadFlow Competitor Research

## Direct Competitors (Lead Gen for Trades)

### 1. Lead Genera / Similar Agencies
- **Pricing:** Usually $0.50-2 per lead, or monthly retainers $500-2k/mo
- **Delivery:** Ongoing, drip-fed
- **Quality:** Variable, often recycled lists

### 2. LinkedIn Sales Navigator + Scrapers
- **Pricing:** ~$100/mo for Navigator + scraping tools
- **Delivery:** DIY
- **Quality:** Good for B2B, not trades

### 3. ZoomInfo / Apollo / Lusha
- **Pricing:** $500-1500/mo
- **Delivery:** Self-serve database
- **Quality:** Good but generic, not trade-specific

## Our Differentiation

1. **Trade-specific** - We only do home services (lawn, plumbing, HVAC, etc.)
2. **Fresh data** - Scraped on order, not recycled lists
3. **All-inclusive** - Email, phone, website in every lead
4. **Fast delivery** - 48 hours, not ongoing drip
5. **Transparent pricing** - Flat rate per batch, no subscriptions

## Positioning

> "The only lead gen service built specifically for marketing agencies serving trades."

## Price Justification

- 500 leads at $997 = $1.99/lead
- Typical agency charges clients $50-200 per lead
- Even at 1% conversion, 5 customers × $2k avg job = $10k value
- Our leads pay for themselves 10x over

## Key Messages

1. "Stop wasting money on dead lists"
2. "Fresh leads, verified data, 48hr delivery"
3. "Built by marketers who work with tradies"

## Objection Handling
