# LeadFlow Cold Email Sequences

## Sequence A: Agency Focus

### Email 1 (Day 0) - Initial Outreach
**Subject:** Quick question about your trade clients

Hey,

Saw {{company}} does marketing for tradies.

Quick question: are your clients always asking for more leads?

We specialize in generating verified trade business leads (lawn care, plumbing, HVAC, etc.) - emails, phones, websites, all validated.

500 leads, 48hr delivery, $997.

Could be a nice add-on service for your agency, or just fuel for your clients' pipelines.

Worth a quick chat?

Cheers,
Tom

### Email 2 (Day 3) - Value Add
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your trade clients

Hey,

Quick follow-up on my note about trade leads.

Just delivered 1,000 verified lawn care leads to a marketing agency last week - they're using them for a cold email campaign for their client.

If lead gen for home service businesses is something you'd use, happy to do a small test batch (50 leads) so you can see the quality.

No charge for the sample - just want to prove it works.

Cheers,
Tom

### Email 3 (Day 7) - Breakup
**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hey,

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If you ever need verified leads for trade businesses (plumbing, HVAC, lawn care, etc.), we're here.

Closing your file for now - no more emails from me.

Cheers,
Tom

## Sequence B: SaaS Company Focus

### Email 1 (Day 0)
**Subject:** Leads for your lawn care / trade customers

Hey,

I see {{company}} sells to home service businesses.

We generate verified lead lists for trades - lawn care, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, etc. 500+ leads with email, phone, website.

Could be useful for your sales team's outbound, or even as a lead magnet for your marketing.

Interested in seeing a sample?

Cheers,

### Email 2 (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Leads for your lawn care / trade customers

Hey,

Following up - we just finished a batch of 500 lawn care businesses in Queensland.

If your sales team is doing outbound to trades, this could save them hours of prospecting.

Want me to send you 20 sample leads to check quality?

### Email 3 (Day 7)
**Subject:** Last one from me

Hey,

I'll take the silence as "not right now" - totally understand.

If you ever need trade business leads for your sales or marketing, give me a shout.

Cheers,
Tom

1. **Personalize** - Use company name, reference something specific
2. **Keep it short** - Under 100 words ideal
3. **One CTA** - Don't give multiple options
4. **Reply-friendly** - End with a question
